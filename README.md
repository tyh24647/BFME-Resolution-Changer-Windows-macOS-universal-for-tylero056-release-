####Description

This application is a cross-platform easy resolution switcher for my releases of the following Lord of the Rings games: "The Battle for Middle-Earth", "The Battle for Middle-Earth II", and "Rise of the Witch King".

For the Mac OS X ports I have released, this application will also modify the current WineSkin configurations for your application to allow/reflect the changes the changes to the resolution consistently--preventing the widescreen settings from being squished into a 4:3 resolution.
